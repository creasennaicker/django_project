QQ LOG:

QQ LOG lets car collectors/enthusiasts log automobile purchases that they make. Once it is logged, they have all the stats of the car/bike. Price, miles, condition, title status and any other notes that may be appropriate to its condition. You can also upload documentation for the vehicle to help with a future sale. When you go to sell the car or bike, you can see what your P/L is. It can also use data from auction results of the same make/ model to see where the trending prices are from sites like bringatrailer.com and carsandbids.com, the two biggest automotive enthusiast auction sites for the average joe.

So if you buy a 1962 triumph spitfire or a 1957 BMW Isetta, you can log your purchase price and records in regard to the sale! When it comes time to sell, you can see recent realized results and other examples for sale. This app will also calculate the total value of your collection.

This is a tool for car and bike collectors!

I will do this using Django, Python, Heroku and Postgres.
